# Burn Controller
Burn Controller is a mod for Kerbal Space Program 2 that lets you set up engine burns, with the ability to set an amount of time to wait before starting a burn, the percentage of thrust, and the duration of the burn.

As of the 0.8.0 update, engine burns can also be set up for maneuver nodes. You can view a short video showing how to do this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1gVaj15n_o).
